# React Native vs Flutter: Which Is More Startup friendly?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Qnt_ctP0ZrlL959Dj3HZAw.jpeg)

由于对移动应用的大量需求，很多公司已经把他们应用开发的重心转移到移动应用上了。

开发新的移动应用，是一个不断有新技术、平台和框架流入的领域。这使得移动开发者可以创建革命性的移动应用。

现在，跨平台应用开发正在创业公司中变得越来越流行。开发者可以用它来设计电子商务应用、各种互动应用和社交应用。

因此，有两个移动应用开发框架，react native 和 flutter，引起了广泛的讨论，并且互相竞争，试图证明自己是跨平台移动应用的最合适的宿主。

React native 是被 Facebook 开发的，并且很快获得了大众的欢迎，使得公司从中获益。Google 的 flutter 是移动应用开发的新技术，但它能够创建美丽的原生应用，并且帮助开发者轻松创建跨平台应用。

在这个博客中，我们基于下述的各种参数，比较了两个移动应用开发框架（react native 和 flutter）。

这将有助于创业公司轻松选择最适合他们开发移动应用的框架。你也可以从顶级的移动应用开发公司 [**招聘开发者**](https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers?utm_source=hiredev_reactflutter_medium&utm_medium=mantra)来使你的开发工作更加出色。

**比较所基于的参数如下：**

1.  **用户界面**

在用户界面中创建块，在 React Native 和 Flutter 中有很大的不同。Reactive Native 是基于 native 组件的。但是，Flutter 的情况是完全不同的。它非常适用于私有的控件。实际上，用户私有的控件非常令人激动，它能给你完全自定义的 UI 设计，以及与原生环境的良好的合作。

不幸的是，这也有一些缺点。举例来说，Cupertino 库缺少 iOS 风格的控件。这对于[**移动应用开发者**](https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers?utm_source=home_reactflutter_medium&utm_medium=mantra)来说，是一个很大的问题。在 react native 对 flutter 的战争中，react native 的用户体验要好很多。

**胜者 (react native 与 flutter 的比较):** React Native

**2) 开发时间**

最近出现的移动应用开发公司擅长按时交付项目，而 React Native 一直是这些公司最好的伙伴之一。这个框架缩短了移动应用开发的时间表，为用户界面添加了内容并减少了开发项目所需的时间。

在 react native 与 flutter 的比较中，Flutter 是新的，并且需要大量的时间开发项目。React Native 具有完整可用的组件，它帮助开发者加速移动应用开发，而不会给开发者带来太多额外的问题。Flutter 也承诺具有很高的可用性，但这个开发框架还需要获得比 react native 更好的声誉。

**胜者（react native 对 flutter）:** React Native

**3) Performance**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Nu2WBSE8G_GilhJ0gzqmmw.png)

A good comparison of these frameworks i.e. react native vs flutter, precisely in terms of performance, gives us revealing results. The mobile app developers who know these languages well would surely agree with this point of rewarding Google Flutter with some extra points. Flutter has the advantage over its competitors due to Dart frame. In addition, the Javascript layer helps to connect with native components more easily.

On the other hand, React Native has had a large following, but app developers know the pain when it comes to creating hybrid applications. But, in the case of native applications, the framework adjusts exceptionally well to the requirements. The framework means that developers do not have problems to create an application that has a native environment.

The use of React Native for hybrid applications makes it a little complicated for developers to run the architect, the native components and the library without problems. Flutter, on the other hand, makes it easy for developers to reuse existing code. The C ++ engine also supports the language, and that gives you reward points.

**4) Stability**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sO7kdtL_RaVhGTCHf881FA.png)

When it comes to comparison of react native vs flutter, stability is one of the most important aspects for [**mobile app development companie**](https://www.valuecoders.com/mobile-application-development?utm_source=home_reactflutter_medium&utm_medium=mantra)**s**. And the competition seems difficult here. Flutter lacked a bit of competition since it only had the Alpha version. The version is not suitable for large projects.

However, in the last year, Google announced Flutter beta 2, which offers impressive beta tools for developers. React Native enjoys the support of a large community and is quite stable since its launch. As Flutter is still making its place in the industry, React Native seems to be the winner of this section in the war of react native vs flutter.

**Winner(react native vs flutter):** React Native

**5) Clientele**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dyDl69cH8Vr-8X0U2PZMkA.jpeg)

The popularity of React Native does not need to mention for businesses these days. It was and still is one of the most promising mobile app development frameworks for developers of all ages. It has all the necessary components important to carry out the project of any size. Speaking particularly about the number of clients of this popular framework, it has some important names, such as Skype, Facebook, Tesla, Airbnb, Instagram, Walmart and many more.

Since Flutter was launched a few years ago, it is still trying to make its presence felt in the industry. As a framework is still making its base, it will take some time to gather the momentum. Currently, only one Hamilton application is what you have in store to show. However, as time progresses, you will surely add important brands to your list.

**Winner(react native vs flutter):** React Native

**6) Documentation & Toolkit**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*B18aQH_4ZDsIoudtJ2gv1g.png)

The process of tools along with the documentation is an extensive process. And when it comes to documentation, Flutter facilitates the process. In addition, it makes it easier for [**mobile app developers**](https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-mobile-app-developers?utm_source=home_reactflutter_medium&utm_medium=mantra) to use them while documenting their application. Therefore, there is no doubt that Flutter is an impressive option against its counterpart.

On the other hand, the documentation with React Native is a bit clumsy. In addition, this framework omits a series of components that are quite important to smooth the process. So we can see that the comparison with respect to the tools brings a hard competition between the two frames. Flutter has extensive IDEs and tools with React Native support. Its compatibility with Visual Studio Code, Android Studio etc. adds more to the prominence of the framework.

**Conclusion:**

So we have seen a detailed comparison of both the [**mobile app development**](https://www.valuecoders.com/mobile-application-development?utm_source=home_reactflutter_medium&utm_medium=mantra) frameworks for start-ups. Both have their own plus points in terms of stability, performance, documentation etc. as discussed above.

However, it is difficult to decide which one is the winner as they have their own pros and cons. In my opinion, Flutter being new framework would take time to get stable and would travel miles to compete successfully with already popular mobile app development framework i.e. React Native. Hence, React Native is a good choice to start with and can be declared as the winner right now.

No doubt, Flutter can also be a good choice as it creates beautiful mobile apps and can help start-ups to earn well in less time. Moreover, it has an impressive future too.
